                    <p class="card-text">It’s been three and a half years since we first met, and even now, our bond feels the same😍. You’ve done so much to make me happy and created so many special memories that I’ll always cherish🤩.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                       

You've always been there for me whenever I needed you. One unforgettable example is our first TCS exam day. I can't imagine how much terrible that day would have been without you and Kiran🥹. But with both of you by my side, it felt like we were a family. When one of us faced a challenge, it felt like all three of us became one to handle it together🥰. and another unforgettable day is when i had fever on exam day, you and kiran came to college early and you both take cared of me 🫰.I vividly remember how much you and kiran did for me during that time. 💛
</p>
<p class="card-text">
You’ve done so much for me, Kiran, and Kusuma—always going out of your way to help us😇😊. Whether it was something small or big, you’d always give it your 100%. You were there whenever we needed you, no questions asked☺. Even when it came to studies, you always stayed focused and made sure we were on track, even if we didn’t take things seriously🤣😂.
</p>
<p class="card-text">
You care for us like no one else🖤. You show it in so many ways— maa medhe arusthav😳 , maa medhe aluguthav😔 ,mammaline ekkuva care chesthav🤗..—but you always have our backs💚. I’ll never forget that one time when you were upset with me. You didn’t eat properly, didn’t talk, and just stayed mad. That day, I realized how much I mean to you💫🫰.
</p>
<p class="card-text">
I remember you once saying we’ve grown distant, but I don’t know if it’s because you got busy or I did. Now , I am saying it’s because you’re the one who’s busy. I miss those days when you’d text me for no reason and even ask why I didn’t message you. These days, you reply late, and we don’t talk as much. So yeah, it feels like you’ve gotten busier💯.

No matter what, I just want you to be happy❤, with lots of smiles😍 and amazing memories🥳🤩. You’re so important to me🫂, Chandu, and I hope this birthday brings you all the happiness you deserve.

                        We might not have shared much during our four years of B.Tech or spoken a lot, but one thing I'll always remember is the class you took for the FLAT subject—it really saved me that semester! 😅 Also, It can’t help me  but wonder—what’s the secret behind your flirting skills with girls and even with boys ? 🤔😂 Wishing you an amazing year ahead! 🎈✨
